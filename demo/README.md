TicTak
======

A TicTakToe example application.
The application is divided between a backend module in FreeDOM that runs the game logic,
and a frontend that displays the user interface.
This demo shows you how to interact with the FreeDOM APIs.

The backend FreeDOM module uses the default provider for the Storage API
to maintain a record of your cumulative score.
The default storage provider is backed by HTML5 localStorage
